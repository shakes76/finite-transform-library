= Introduction =

FRTW is especially designed to do Discrete Radon Transforms (DRT). These include the Fast/Finite Radon Transform (FRT) of Bolker, Grigoryan, Gertner, Fill and others (1986-1989) and the Mojette Transform of Guedon et al. (1995). See my [http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.1965 pre-print paper] on these transforms for more details.
